# Absolute-Java-3rd-Ed-Project-Solutions
This is my attempt at solving the projects listed in Walter Savitch's Absolute Java 3rd Edition.

These solutions are not meant to represent model solutions. If there are bugs or design issues, feel free to make some issues/comment.

UPDATE: Only chapter 1 has ever been done. For more than a year now. Maybe one day I'll do the rest.
